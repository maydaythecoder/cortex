3. **Developer Experience**: Clear syntax, excellent error messages, and powerful tooling
4. **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless interoperability with NumPy, PyTorch, ONNX, and more
5. **Gradual Complexity**: Simple for beginners, powerful for experts

### Target Use Cases

- **Research**: Rapid prototyping of new ML algorithms
- **Production**: High-performance model inference and training
- **Education**: Teaching ML concepts with a language designed for the domain
- **Edge Computing**: Efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices

## Design Decisions

### Language Design

1. **Bracket-based Syntax**: `func add[a, b] | return[a + b] ^`
   - **Rationale**: Clear, unambiguous, and ML-friendly
   - **Trade-off**: Different from C-style languages, but more readable

2. **Type System**: Gradual typing with inference
   - **Rationale**: Balance between safety and flexibility
   - **Trade-off**: More complex implementation, but better developer experience

3. **Memory Management**: Automatic with optional manual control
   - **Rationale**: ML workloads need predictable memory usage
   - **Trade-off**: GC overhead, but prevents memory leaks

### Implementation Choices

1. **LLVM Backend**: Industry-standard, well-supported
   - **Rationale**: Mature toolchain, excellent optimization
   - **Trade-off**: Learning curve, but long-term benefits

2. **Python Interop**: First-class Python integration
   - **Rationale**: Leverage existing ML ecosystem
   - **Trade-off**: Runtime overhead, but ecosystem access

3. **GPU Support**: CUDA first, OpenCL second
   - **Rationale**: CUDA has better ML library support
   - **Trade-off**: Vendor lock-in, but better performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **LLVM Complexity**: Start with simple IR generation, iterate
2. **Performance**: Benchmark early and often, optimize hot paths
3. **Ecosystem**: Focus on core features first, add interop later
4. **GPU Support**: Begin with CPU, add GPU incrementally

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to ML-focused features, avoid general-purpose language
2. **Community**: Build in public, engage early adopters
3. **Documentation**: Write docs as you code, not after
4. **Testing**: Test-driven development, especially for compiler
