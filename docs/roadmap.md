## Design Decisions

### Language Design

1. **Bracket-based Syntax**: `func add[a, b] | return[a + b] ^`
   - **Rationale**: Clear, unambiguous, and ML-friendly
   - **Trade-off**: Different from C-style languages, but more readable

2. **Type System**: Gradual typing with inference
   - **Rationale**: Balance between safety and flexibility
   - **Trade-off**: More complex implementation, but better developer experience

3. **Memory Management**: Automatic with optional manual control
   - **Rationale**: ML workloads need predictable memory usage
   - **Trade-off**: GC overhead, but prevents memory leaks

### Implementation Choices

1. **LLVM Backend**: Industry-standard, well-supported
   - **Rationale**: Mature toolchain, excellent optimization
   - **Trade-off**: Learning curve, but long-term benefits

2. **Python Interop**: First-class Python integration
   - **Rationale**: Leverage existing ML ecosystem
   - **Trade-off**: Runtime overhead, but ecosystem access

3. **GPU Support**: CUDA first, OpenCL second
   - **Rationale**: CUDA has better ML library support
   - **Trade-off**: Vendor lock-in, but better performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **LLVM Complexity**: Start with simple IR generation, iterate
2. **Performance**: Benchmark early and often, optimize hot paths
3. **Ecosystem**: Focus on core features first, add interop later
4. **GPU Support**: Begin with CPU, add GPU incrementally

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to ML-focused features, avoid general-purpose language
2. **Community**: Build in public, engage early adopters
3. **Documentation**: Write docs as you code, not after
4. **Testing**: Test-driven development, especially for compiler

## Conclusion

Cortex represents a bold vision for the future of ML programming. By combining the expressiveness of modern languages with the performance of compiled code and the domain expertise of ML-first design, we can create a language that makes ML more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable.

The roadmap is ambitious but achievable, with clear milestones and success criteria. The key is to focus on core value propositions: performance, developer experience, and ML-native features. With careful execution and community engagement, Cortex can become the go-to language for the next generation of ML applications.
